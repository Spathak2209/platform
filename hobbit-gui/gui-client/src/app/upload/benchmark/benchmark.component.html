  <p>
    Every benchmark that should be run on the Hobbit platform needs to be uploaded to it. This uploading comprises several steps.
    Note that a <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/master.html#user-registration" target="_blank">user profile</a>    is necessary to have the right to upload something to the platform.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Before uploading, the benchmark has to be implemented in a way that it fits into the platform and is able to interact with
      the paltform controller. The general development of a benchmark is <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/benchmark_integration.html"
        target="_blank">described here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second step is the creation of at least one project in the <a href="http://git.project-hobbit.eu/" target="_blank">gitlab instance</a>      of the platform. For that you can use the same account as for the platform itself. (The project should have the same
      name as the system. Please have a look at the <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/master.html#upload-a-benchmark"
        target="_blank">image upload</a> and its hints regarding the project name.)
    </li>
    <li>
      After creating the git project(s), you need to push the Docker image(s) to the git project(s) as <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/system_integration.html#pushing-the-image"
        target="_blank">described here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The final step is to put the meta data describing the benchmark into a file called benchmark.ttl and push it to one of the
      git projects. The format of the file is <a href="https://hobbit-project.github.io/system_integration.html#4-writing-the-systemttl-file"
        target="_blank">described here</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>
